ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page!

- I'm a Data Professional with a mixed (Software Engineering/Data Science) background. I have worked mostly as individual contributer with small startups.

- I mostly work on private repos, so not much stuff in here.

- Single handedly architected, designed, and wrote the backend system of Exmplr (a data analysis for clinical trials). 

- Created [ChatMM](https://chat.nkubed.io/). Converse and explore multi-modal machine learning models. Be sure to check it out!
